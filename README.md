Desktop applications for handling the day-to-day activities at a grocery store

The /Server folder stores the profile photo and signature of each customer.

Run /LogIn/src/ServerSide/ServerUI.java and login to start the server.

Once the server is started, run /LogIn/src/login/LogIn1.java for starting the client application. This file can be run on multiple computers so that different clients can shop at the same time.
